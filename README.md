# TYPING-SPEED-GAME-PYTHON

In this Python project idea, we are going to build an exciting project through which you can check and even improve your typing speed. For a graphical user interface, we are going to use the pygame library which is used for working with graphics. We will draw the images and text to be displayed on the screen.

The project in Python requires you to have basic knowledge of python programming and the pygame library.

Background.jpg – A background image we will use in our program.

Icon.png – An icon image that we will use as a reset button.

Sentences.txt – This text file will contain a list of sentences separated by a new line.

Speed typing.py – The main program file that contains all the code.

typing-speed-open.jpg – The image to display when starting game.

First, we have created the sentences.txt file in which we have added multiple sentences separated by a new line.
